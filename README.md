# Kickstarter Analysis
## Project Overview
 Louise, an up and coming play writer who wants to start a crowfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She is estimating a budget of over $10,000 and hesistant about starting the fundraising campaign. We are going run analysis using Excel to provide Louise with helpful insight based on campaigns that has already been held.

## Analysis and Challenges
#### Description

First we formated and sorted the data based on the variable we are insterested in to help Louise make informed decisions. 
Then color coded outcomes to have a view of live, successful, canceled and failed campaigns at a glance.
Next we looked at the percentage of plegdes to goals and also looked at the avearage donation dividing the pledges by the number of backers(people who made the pledges).

Since Louise is interested in theater play campaigns, we made our data more detailed by spliting the Category and subcategory into 2 columns in order to get more understanding. Adding visuals to our analysis will give Louise additional insights so we made a pivot table of the outcomes of the categories,  plotted the graph . Diving further we went ahead to make a pivot table and plotted the outcomes of subcategory  To better inform Louise we looked at the line chart of the outcomes as against the various months igns with comparatively low failed campaigns as well. So we can advice Louise on May and Febuary as the ideal months to attain high success rate.

At this stage we encounted a few challenges, because some of the campaigns had no backers, which gave us an error in the calculation of our avearage donation. We used the IFFERROR function to set all error entries 0, because we needed a numerical value for that column.



and we found that theater saw the most number of successes

and this also showed that theater play had the most successful event.

and campaigns held in the month of May were more successful, however they also had the highest failed events as well. In the same light Febuary had a relatively high succesful campa
